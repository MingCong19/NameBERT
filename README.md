Cultural Signatures in Names: An LLM Approach
This repository contains a clean and reproducible implementation for predicting nationality from personal names using classical and neural NLP models.
The project focuses on dataset curation, taxonomy alignment, and robust evaluation across highly imbalanced, long-tail classes.

Due to privacy and licensing constraints, only sanitized sample data is included.

Project Overview
	•	Task: Multi-class nationality classification from names
	•	Scale: Up to 99 countries (with hierarchical / curriculum variants)
	•	Models:
	•	Character- and token-based baselines (e.g., LSTM)
	•	Multilingual BERT fine-tuning
	•	Key challenges addressed:
	•	Severe class imbalance
	•	Noisy real-world name sources
	•	Taxonomy mismatch across datasets
	•	Evaluation stability on long-tail classes
